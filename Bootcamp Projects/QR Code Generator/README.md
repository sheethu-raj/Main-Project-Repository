# Bootcamp-Projects-QR-Code-Generator

This Node.js application generates a QR code from a URL provided by the user. 
The application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt the user for a URL, and the `qr-image` package to create the QR code. 
Once the URL is entered, the app generates a PNG image file (`qr-image.png`) containing the QR code and saves the URL in a text file (`URL.txt`). 
Both files are created in the current directory.
